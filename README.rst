Butcher
=======
Butcher is a `shmux <http://web.taranis.org/shmux/>`_-based shell for executing commands within Chef-managed infrastructure.

Installation
------------
First, you need to install shmux itself. You may check whether there's a package available for your distribution, or just build it from sources (`latest available release <http://web.taranis.org/shmux/dist/shmux-1.0.2.tgz>`_). 

Butcher itself can be installed via setup.py, like this
.. code::
  sudo python setup.py install
